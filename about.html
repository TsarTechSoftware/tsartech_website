		TsarTech is owned and operated by Nick Zamora - a Software Engineer who has some experience in Computer, and Electrical Engineering. Nick spent six years in college; three for his associates, and three for his bachelors. He first attended Southwestern Oregon Community College (SOCC) from 2011 to 2014, and then for his bachelors he studied at Seattle Pacific University (SPU). His associates include: Associates of Arts Oregon Transfer, Associates of Science, and Associates of General Studies. His undergraduate degrees include: Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Computer Engineering. During his time at SPU, Nick did several side projects that sparked his interest in learning more about engineering. This projects include a smart-quadcopter with self-correction capabilities, a personal video game, a synthesizer, and more. Some of his collegues at SPU noticed his eagerness to work with things that weren't paticularily in his field. This brought Zamora to someone who needed help with a project they were working on: a system that could detect the sound of fighter jets and helicopters. This project was meant to be a humanitarian effort to detect danger for Syrians civillians, to alert them when there are approaching threats. With research and a small budget, Nick Zamora was able to create a system powered by a Raspberry Pi to implement the plan. He used an algorithm similar to Shazam, the music recognizing application; but instead of giving the algorithm songs to compare to, he used samples of several different kinds of jets and helicopters. This piqued the interest of Zamora and he began finding more people who needed help or an advisor. He tutored several of his friends for programming class, and acquired more clients. This continued until Zamora wanted to create a business to allow those in need to use the skill he could provide. The goal of TsarTech is to provide teams with a versitile set of thinkers, that are able to implement software and engineering.
